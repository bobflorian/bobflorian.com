_This is my site, there are many like it, but this one is mine._

This site is built from the following tech:

+ Code stored in [GitHub](https://www.github.com)

    + All it takes to publish a new post, or correct something is a push to this repository.  Netlify takes care of everything else, like hosting, CDN, deployments.  I can even post things from my cell phone if I wanted (because I set up some dev tools to author MarkDown pages and push to GitHub)
    
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) Static site generator
