# Day 1

Car service picked us up 2pm.  Guy was 15 minutes late.

630pm Flight to Doha, Qatar

9 hour layover in Doha, likely just staying in the airport and sleeping.

Ate at the Italian place for dinner, greek salad and pizzas.

Wandered the airport multiple times, there were several mini parks for kids to play on.  

The airport was very nice, modern, and easy to navigate, with all signs in English and Arabic.  Ended up doing about 18000 steps in the airport to keep busy.
