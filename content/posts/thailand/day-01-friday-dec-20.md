Bolingbrook - 1400

Car service was supposed to pick us up at 2pm, but he was 15 minutes late.  You'd think they try to be early or on-time as they know we're going to the airport.

630pm Flight to Doha, Qatar

9 hour layover in Doha, likely just staying in the airport and sleeping.

Ate at the Italian place for dinner, greek salad and pizzas.

Wandered the airport multiple times, there were several mini parks for kids to play on.  

The airport was very nice, modern, and easy to navigate, with all signs in English and Arabic.  Ended up doing about 18000 steps in the airport to keep busy.
