Bolingbrook - 2pm local time.  All packed and ready to go!  We've minimized what we're bringing with to just a small duffle back each and a backpack.  (for 2 weeks!)

Car service was supposed to pick us up at 2pm, but he was 15 minutes late.  You'd think they try to be early or on-time as they know we're going to the airport.  Non one needs this kind of stress before an international flight.

630pm Flight to Doha, Qatar

9 hour layover in Doha, plan is to likely stay in the airport and some sleeping.

Ate at the Italian place for dinner, greek salad and pizzas. My Greek salad wasn't so great, oh well.

Wandered the airport multiple times, there were several mini parks for kids to play on.  Aiden had fun climbing on the structures in the parks.

The airport is very nice, modern, and easy to navigate -- with all signs in English and Arabic.  Ended up doing about 18000 steps in the airport to keep busy.
