# Day 5 - day two, and night two at teh hintok river camp at hellfire pass

we woke up about 600 to the sounds of roosters in the neighborhood

got dressed and packed for the day of adventure

met the guide for breakfast, which was mostly traditional western style breakfast, but I chose the Thai dishes of pork rice porride soup, which I added cilantro, basil, picked peppers, and pepper flakes

after breakfast we hopped in the van for a 1 hour ride to the "camp" where we were to ride bikes and kayak.  The camp was a very large facility where locals come, school groups and such.  there was an olpymic size pool even.

We were met by our local guide for this trip, and the person to give the safety breiefing.  Safety guy was seeminly a French national, but his English was very good and refined.  He gave us a 5 minute safety briefing about paddling, and then about the bikes and how to change gears and brake (which wasn't really neeeded in our case)

After the safety briefing we were off with our guide PiaPia?? Into the coutryside of the area, where we rode through the local farms, countryside, and along some main roads with all of the crazy drivers and motor bikes.  We saw banana trees, jackfruit growing, rubber trees, long beans, basil and other unidentifiable things.  They were surprised that I had Thai basil growing at home, but I explained that many Americansa grow herb gardens in their kitchens or at home.  After biking a few km we stopped at a local farmers work station where they were processing long beans.  Our guide just hopped off his bike, told Aiden to "come here" - "try a bean" and pulled a bean off the vine and we all ate some; which was kind of like a mix between a string bean and edamame, but a little sweeter.  Afte biking a little bit further, we stopped at a local fruit stand in the middle of no where.  There were 3 people, seeminly 3 generations of ladies working the farm stand and one gentlemen cleaning and processing jack fruit.  Our guide bought some jack fruit off them for us for a snack, and it was very very good.  Kind of like a crunchy melon!  We'll have to see if we can find any in the US when we get back.  Here we also tried some pickled tamarind, which was just OK, but the locals gave us some powder to put on the tamarind, which was sour-something; and kind of made the tamarind into a sour candy type of thing; it was pretty good, but the jaack fruit was better.  After just a few more km; the biking portion was over, and on to the kayayking.

Oh, I forgot, during the entire bike ride, we had a truck following us with our kayaks.  Whenever we had to cross the street, the guy in the truck would get out and stop traffic for us by standing in it!

For the kayaking we switched into our water shoes and got right into the paddling.  There were many floating houses on the river, some more or less shantys, but some were near luxurious.    We paddled and paddled for about an hour, seeing the villages and river's inner workings.

After paddling we finished up, and cleaned up for a short trip back in the van.  Aiden tried the climbing wall just a bit, and the guide helped him without a harness.  For lunch we stopped at a seeminly very nice restaurant, where we had cachew chicken, vegetables, and our guide shared some local spicy soup, which was very spicy, but very tasty.  It had all soerts of chicken bits, bones and unidentifable pieces in it.  Waza bought us all some ice cream for desert, which was very good chocolate ice cream cones.

After finishing lunch we needed to drive to the Erewan National Park, where there are many many tiered waterfalls.  We hiked up to "level 4" - which is all we had time before since the Rangers/Soldiers started to close levels off beginnging at 330pm.  The water was pretty cold, but I put my feet in, and Aiden went all in most places.  There were many many lamprey fish here "doctor fish" who will eat the dead skin off your leg and feet.  If you keep still they will come up and just start pecking at you, which was very very strange.  We stayed at station 3 for about 20 minutes while Aiden swam with all of the other tourists.  Then we hiked up 4, then 2, and back to one.  Aiden swam at all of them.  He tried to catch a fish, but it was very very hard.  At the one station there were rock slides, where Aiden went down many many times, and lost his water shoe!  Some local Thai boys tried to find it for him, but could not.

After the park, we stopped to get some iced coffee, where it seems that coffee is stronger, and better here... not suer why, will need to find out.

For our drive back our guide stoped off at another hotel resort she was friendly with, and they let us swim in the hot tub and pool; where we met some people from Nevada, and talked with another guide, who was leading 15 Germans though the country.  The hot tub was very hot, and pool was code, but it was very nice.  There was a place where Aiden could feed some fish, and did so several times with some other local kids.

After this it was a short ride back to the camp where our driver got lost several times since it was very very dark out.

We got dinner straight away, Aiden tried to raost some marshemllows that we picked up at a 7-11, but the bamboo fire was too too hot.  Once glass of wine later and itwas time for bed.  Wakek up call is at 6am to pack, breakfast and be on the road by 8am for an all day drive to Siktohkai - the ancient land of Thailand, and prior capital.  Waza said she'll be stopping at many places for us to strectch, eat, and see some local markets.

Oh, by the way, it's Christmas!  It's hard to tell here, sicne the days have started to run together, and no locals here celebrate it, but that's OK!
