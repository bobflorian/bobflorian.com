We wake up at the hill tribe lodge and meet Waza for breakfast, at you guessed it, a buffet breakfast.

Today we drive to back to Chiang Mai, but first stop is at the ELEPHANTS.  We go to the Elephant Nature Park near Chiang Mai, which is a sanctuary for Elephants.  Many of the local tourist places that tout riding them are very bad to visit.  The owner of the ENP tells us his story, the story of each elephant, and why he treats them all differently here.

We need to dress in some local garb, and so that the elephants kind of recognize us as someone who wants to help with them and feed them.

They eat so much food!  After hearing all of the historical information we finally get to go meet the elephants.  There are 6 of them today to be with us.  They are ready and lined up for snacks!  Today we all feed them snacks of bananas and sugar cane.  They are very gentle with their trunks.  They can very easily take a banana from your hands.  Sometimes they'll hold on to 20-30 bananas and sugar cane before stuffing it into their mouths!  We all took turns and fed them many times for about 20 minutes.

From here we walked through the landscape and hills and stopped every once and a while to learn some more about the care of them and what it takes.  They try to grow as much of the food on site, but they cannot grow enough to meet their needs, so they buy _organic only_ food from local suppliers.

Sometimes the elephants stop and scratch on a tree of stick, which is kind of funny to watch.  They are so good with their trunks that they can pick up a stick off the ground to scratch their backs or bellies with.


The owner carries a large knife, and he kindly explains why since some people might be aprehensive.  He said it's not ever for use against elephants or people.  Mostly to cut food, plants in the way, and for snakes!  Cobras can be particularly vicious as he explains, but he's not afraid of them anymore.


Back to RatiLanna, for new years party!  it's much more crowded at the hotel now.
