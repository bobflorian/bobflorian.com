Travel back to USA, part one.  

leave the hotel at 530am, go to the Chiang Mai airport, which is only 15 minutes from the RatiLanna hotel.  

Flight is at 8am, bach to Doha.  On this flight we have an entire row on the plane to ourselves.

After we arrive at Doha, about 1230 local time, we go to the Transit Tour Desk run by the government and Qatari Airlines. We sign up for a local city bus tour at 3pm.  

Immigration --- again.

Bus tour in Doha to 4 best places to see.

Souq Waqif - market - with the unique parade.  SO many smells, sights, food, and animals to buy in the maze of a market.  There's a Russian Circus in the parking lot!

After back at the airport we ate at Burger King for dinner.  First time I've been at a BK in probably 10 years.  

From here we were pretty tired and found a family quiet room to chill in.  Luckily found 3 chairs next to each other.  The lounge chairs only recline about 3/4 of the way, so sleeping on them in very hard for me.  I think I sleep for maybe 3 or 4 hours.
