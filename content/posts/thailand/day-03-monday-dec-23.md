Woke up after sleeping for 13-14 hours! 

Got room service of Chinese Breakfast, scrambled eggs, bacon, and pork belly bbq breakfast for Aiden. Multiple coffees!

#### Private Bangkok tour with our guide Eddie!

At 1030am we had to meet our local guide Eddie for a tour of Bangkok. I booked Eddie through [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g293916-d11456468-Private_Guide_In_and_Around_Bangkok_Custom_Tour-Bangkok.html). He was waiting for us in the hotel lobby at the arranged time. We quickly discussed a plan of what to do and embarked on our trip. We left for the SkyTrain which was pretty neat. It was kind of like the EL in Chicago, but nicely air conditioned. He explained that most locals cannot afford to ride the train as it's kind of expensive.

After a short ride on the SkyTrain, we got on a ferry boat to ride up the river a bit to the farthest place.

First stop was the Grand Palace, where there were countless Template and buildings. Everything is very picturesque. We walked around here for about an hour taking pictures and seeing things.  It was very very crowded, even on a weekday.

#### Wat Pho - the reclining Buddha

#### Wat Arun - Temple of the Dawn

We ended at the biggest flower market in Bangkok, which was insane!  So many flowers, smells, and people!  Aiden was just walking around in front of us and didn't see a motor bike _inside the market_ and our guide had to grab him out of the way!

After this we were really tired of walking around and seeing things so we said goodbye to our guide, where he called us a Grab back to our hotel.

For dinner we went to the sushi restaurant in the hotel lobby, [Zuma](https://guide.michelin.com/en/bangkok-region/bangkok/restaurant/zuma#), which was pretty good, including the deserts!
