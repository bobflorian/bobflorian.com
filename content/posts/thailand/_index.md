Hey ya'll.  This is a long story. Much longer than could possibly be posted well on social media.

This is our story of our trip to Thailand with REI.

I'm a strong believer in that travel is transformational on many levels.  [https://www.businessinsider.com/transformational-travel-experiential-luxury-safari-trends-2019-8]
<blockquote>Haupert told Forbes that ultimately, transformational travel means people should carry what they've learned on their travels home with them.

"Travel, at its purest, shifts perspectives, unleashes imagination, inspires understanding and cultivates empathy, which in turn promises peace," Haupert said. "... personal transformation results in global transformation."</blockquote>

I pretty much plan my vacations around food, and this is NO EXCEPTION.  We eat ALL THE THINGS!

Best to start all the way back at day 1, the beginning of our journey.  There are picture galleries on each page.  Feel free to share, comment, and engage on each page!

I've uploaded very high resolution pictures, so apologies in advance if they take a quick moment to load. Trust me, they'll look better.
