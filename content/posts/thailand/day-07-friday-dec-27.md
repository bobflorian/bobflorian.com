Today is full day in Sukhothai.

We woke up and ate breakfast at the buffet, which was as usual a mix of american and Thai food.

We met our guide Waza at 830 behind the hotel near the ntrance to the Wat Changlom, the temple of elephants.  Here we did a quick tour of the temple wiht our new local guide for the day, who runs a biking tour company in the city.  Apparently he runs the best in the city, and there's an article about him in the city osmewhere, I will have to find.

We rode for about 20 km through the temples, where he gave us much much history of the area, in very good detail for someone who didn't know anything about the area, culture, or philophy of Buddism. 

The grand temple was the best, where we walked around ourselves for about 20 minutes taking a lot of pictures. 

We rode through the local streets, and he prides himself upon showing tourists the lesser seen, more local parts of the area, and not just the main template that people take pictures at.  We stopped at one persons house where they breed, train, and sell fighting chickens.  He explained how the chickens are kept for and what the locals do with them, but also explained how gambling is illegal now, and they could be fined for doing so, so chicken fighting is illegal, but locals still do it for a hobby.

We stopped at a new local dig site where they were trying to excavate newly found pottery ovens and "factories" found around the templtes.  We saw some samples of what hadh been found.

Hindu temple with bat cave, and lizard on the ground

Lunch was skipped becuase we were so full from so m uch eating the day before, but before we left our biking guide, he gave us some local snacks from a local family.  The fried rice flour cakesk with peanuts were very very good, I had 3, and Aiden ate maybe 10 mini bananas!

After that we tried to go back to our room, but the maid was cleaning the room, so we laid around the grounds in the library, and next to the pool for about an hour.  After that we went into the ppool, which was surprizingly cold, even thought it was 87 degrees outside.  At some point Waza joined us and we chatted more about local culture and food.  We shared stories from the US and about Aiden, along with some pictures.

We then showered and rested in the room until dinner time, where we ordered off the menu.   Aiden orded the crispy pork, I got the massaman curry, and chrissy the pepper pork with rice. Waza joined us and brought us some local food from the kitchen that the local staff was eating too.  It was a rice broth, and a spicy soup with (chicken?) in it, and many local vegetables.  It was very good, and Aiden ate most of the rice water down very very fast.  Rest of dinner was good, and we wawtched the beginnging of the show again.  Bed tiem.

Tomorrow is a travel day to Chiangmai, our new home base for the rest of the trip.  Will be a 5+ hour drive, but Waza said she will be taking us to a pottery class to make and paint pottery!
